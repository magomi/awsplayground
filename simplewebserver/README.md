# Simple webserver

To play around with loadbalancing features I needed a configuration and some root content for a simple webserver.

## config

The content of the userdata file can be used to do the base config of the aws instance.

It installs the httpd package and downloads the root content.

## webroot

Check this directory out or download it and copy its content to your webservers root.

It will show a simple dead end sign.

Nothing more.
